    <h1>SHAHI PANEER</h1>
    <img src="shahi paneer.jpeg" alt="shahi paneer"/>
    <p>Shahi Paneer is a Mughlai dish where paneer is cooked in a creamy gravy 
       made of onions, yogurt, nut and seeds. As the name suggests, Shahi Paneer
       literally means “Paneer for the Royalty”. </p>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder</li>
        <li>4 tomatoes, pureed</li>
        <li>½ pound paneer, cubed</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Making</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the onion 
        and garlic in the hot oil until the onions are soft and golden brown, 
        about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder
        over the onion and garlic; continue cooking until the seasonings are fragrant, 
        about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour the pureed tomatoes into the skillet; cook until the excess liquid evaporates 
        and the oil separates, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the paneer, water, sugar, and salt to the 
        mixture; stir gently so the paneer does not break apart. Cook until the paneer begins to 
        absorb some of the liquid, about 10 minutes. Stir the cream into the mixture and simmer 
        another 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve.
